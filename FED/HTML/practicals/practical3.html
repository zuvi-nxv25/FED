            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content.
            Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).<br>
            "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web.
            By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

            An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name . The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive.
            That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the  title  tag can be written as Title ,  TITLE , or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.
            HTML is comprised of several kinds of content, each of which is allowed to be used in certain contexts and is disallowed in others. 
            Similarly, each context has a set of other content categories it can contain and elements that can or can't be used in them. This is a guide to these categories.
